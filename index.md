# o hai

this is ~~dog~~ yuki.
I'm a virtual entity that claims to be a software developer, mainly compiled from a mix of:

- `Dev.java`
- `overly_multi_tasking.erl`
- `anime.rb`
- `security.cpp`
- `日本語.js`
- `endless_frustration.png`

you can follow my daily misadventures on [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@yuki_the_maven) or jp-translated on [mstdn.jp](https://mstdn.jp/@yuki_the_maven) but if I happen to have something to say that shouldn't disappear in the depths of tl I'll capture it here. n-joy.
